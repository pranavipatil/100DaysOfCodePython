# Day 08 – Tuples in Python

## ✔ What I Learned Today
- What tuples are and how to create them
- Difference between list and tuple
- Accessing tuple elements using indexing
- Common tuple operations
- Why tuples are immutable

## Concepts Covered
- Tuple creation
- Indexing (positive & negative)
- Slicing tuples
- Built-in functions:
  - len()
  - min()
  - max()
  - count()
  - index()

## Tasks Completed
1. Create a tuple of numbers
2. Access first, last, and middle elements
3. Slice a tuple
4. Use tuple functions
5. Convert tuple to list and list to tuple

## Code Written
See `main.py` in this folder.

## 📌 Notes
- Tuples are immutable (cannot be modified).
- Tuples use parentheses `()`.
- Tuples are faster than lists.
