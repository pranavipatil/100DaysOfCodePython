# Day 04 – If / Else Conditions

## ✔ What I Learned Today
- How Python makes decisions using `if`, `else`, and `elif`
- Using comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- Using logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- How conditional statements help in real-life decision-making

## Concepts Covered
- Simple if statement
- if–else statement
- if–elif–else ladder
- Nested conditions
- Logical operators

## Tasks Completed
1. Check if a number is even or odd  
2. Check if a person is eligible to vote  
3. Check the largest of three numbers  
4. Write a simple grading system using marks

## Code Written
See `main.py` in this folder.

## 📌 Notes
- Python uses indentation instead of `{}`.
- Conditions always evaluate to `True` or `False`.
