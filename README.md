# 100 Days of Code – Python by Pranavi

This repository documents my journey in the 100 Days of Code challenge.  
Every day, I write Python code, learn something new, and upload my progress here.


##  Goals
- Improve Python fundamentals  
- Practice coding daily  
- Build real projects  
- Maintain discipline & consistency  


##  How This Challenge Works
- Each day has its own folder (day01, day02, ..., day100)  
- Every folder contains:
  - `main.py` → Code written for the day  
  - `README.md` → Notes and summary of what I learned
