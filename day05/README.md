# Day 05 – Loops (for & while)

## ✔ What I Learned Today
- How to repeat actions using loops
- Difference between `for` loop and `while` loop
- Using `range()` in Python
- Loop control with counters

## Concepts Covered
- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `range(start, stop, step)`
- Looping through numbers
- Basic loop exercises

## Tasks Completed
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10  
2. Print even numbers between 1–20  
3. Print the table of a given number  
4. Sum of first 10 natural numbers  
5. Countdown loop using while  

## Code Written
See `main.py` in this folder.

## 📌 Notes
- `for` is best when number of iterations is known.
- `while` is best when repeating until a condition becomes false.
