# Day 06 – Pattern Printing

## ✔ What I Learned Today
- How to use nested loops to print patterns
- Difference between outer loop (rows) and inner loop (columns)
- Understanding how loops control shape and alignment in output

## Concepts Covered
- Nested for loops
- Controlling rows and columns
- Printing stars and numbers in patterns

## Tasks Completed
1. Print a left triangle pattern  
2. Print a reverse left triangle pattern  
3. Print a square of stars (5x5)  
4. Print a number triangle pattern  

## Code Written
See `main.py` in this folder.

## 📌 Notes
- Patterns help build strong logic and nested loop understanding.
- Outer loop = number of rows.
- Inner loop = number of columns.
