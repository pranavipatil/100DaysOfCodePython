# Day 09 – Sets in Python

## ✔ What I Learned Today
- What sets are and how to create them
- How sets automatically remove duplicate values
- Common set operations like union, intersection, and difference
- Adding and removing elements from a set

## Concepts Covered
- Set creation
- Uniqueness property of sets
- Set methods:
  - add()
  - remove()
  - discard()
  - pop()
- Set operations:
  - union()
  - intersection()
  - difference()

## Tasks Completed
1. Create a set with duplicate values
2. Add and remove elements from a set
3. Perform union, intersection, and difference
4. Check membership in a set
5. Find length of a set

## Code Written
See `main.py` in this folder.

## 📌 Notes
- Sets are unordered.
- Sets do not allow duplicate values.
- Sets are mutable.
