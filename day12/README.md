# Day 12 – Recursion in Python

## ✔ What I Learned Today
- What recursion is and how it works
- Base case and recursive case
- How recursion reduces a problem step by step
- When to use recursion

## Concepts Covered
- Recursive function
- Base condition
- Recursive call
- Stack behavior (conceptual)

## Tasks Completed
1. Print numbers from 1 to n using recursion
2. Find factorial of a number using recursion
3. Find sum of first n natural numbers using recursion
4. Find nth Fibonacci number using recursion

## Code Written
See `main.py` in this folder.

## 📌 Notes
- Every recursive function must have a base case.
- Without a base case, recursion causes infinite calls.
- Recursion is useful for problems that can be broken into smaller subproblems.
